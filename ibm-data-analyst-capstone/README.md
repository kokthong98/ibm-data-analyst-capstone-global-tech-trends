# IBM Data Analyst Capstone Project

## 🚀 Overview

This project is my comprehensive Data Analyst capstone, completed as part of the IBM Data Analyst Professional Certificate. It demonstrates my end-to-end skills in data collection, cleaning, wrangling, exploratory analysis, visualization, and dashboarding using real-world developer survey data.

**Highlights:**
- Data sourced from APIs, web scraping, job postings, and the Stack Overflow Developer Survey
- Extensive data cleaning, wrangling, and feature engineering
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and outlier handling
- Advanced visualizations in Jupyter (matplotlib), Google Looker Studio, and Power BI (for self-learning/portfolio)
- Interactive dashboards and actionable business insights
- Final business presentation and storytelling
